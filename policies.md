# EDUC 6144: Course Policies and Support

---

## Academic Integrity

All students are expected to abide by the code of academic integrity throughout the course. Academic dishonesty—including cheating, fabrication, and plagiarism—will not be tolerated and will be addressed according to University policy. Consequences may include:
- Failing the course
- Notation on permanent record/transcript
- Expulsion from the program

For details on expected student conduct, see the [Code of Academic Integrity](https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity/).

## Attendance Policy

### Regular Attendance

Since there are limited class meetings in a semester, attendance at every class is expected. If you must miss a class due to extraordinary circumstances:
- Contact the instructor **before** the class
- Provide a valid reason for missing

### Mandatory First Class Attendance

All students are required to attend the first class. Exceptions are granted only for extraordinary circumstances such as:
- Natural disasters
- Serious illnesses
- Court appearances
- Personal crises

Unexcused absences from the first class may result in disenrollment or significant point penalties.

## Late Work Policy

- **10% deduction** per day for late submissions
- Extensions must be negotiated **at least one week before** the due date
- Assignments submitted **7 or more days late** receive a failing grade

---

## Accommodations

Students requiring accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act should:

1. Contact [Student Disability Services](https://www.vpul.upenn.edu/lrc/sds/) at 215-573-9235
2. Do this at the **very beginning of the semester**

Student Disability Services will work directly with the instructor regarding appropriate accommodations.

## Generative AI Policy

We anticipate that generative AI tools can benefit your participation and learning in some parts of this course. For example, you may want to explore more details about a particular theory of learning.

### If You Use AI Tools

If you use generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT):
- **You will not be penalized**
- **You must acknowledge** when and where you used them, particularly in written responses (discussion posts, papers)
- **Retain a record** of your prompts and/or interactions for later replication if needed

### Important Limitations

Be aware that:
- Large language models frequently generate incorrect facts and fake citations
- Code generation models produce inaccurate outputs
- Image generation models can occasionally produce offensive content

### Your Responsibility

You are responsible for any inaccurate, biased, offensive, or otherwise unethical content you submit—regardless of whether it originated from you or a generative AI tool.

**Failure to acknowledge AI use** will result in penalties.

## Course Norms and Expectations

Our class engages in small group experiences and large group discussions. A successful class depends on every member actively collaborating as both learners and teachers.

### Expectations

- **Come to class on time**
- **Read assigned texts carefully** before class
- **Participate actively** in discussions
- Respect that each of us has valuable perspectives and experiences

### Collaborative Learning Community

It is my assumption that each of us has valuable perspectives and experiences that will inform our collective, developing knowledge. Our online and in-class discussions are spaces for building knowledge together.
