## Knowledge Building Participation (30%)

**Ongoing throughout semester**

### Purpose

Contribute to our collective knowledge advancement as a knowledge building community. Your participation spans two platforms that work together.

### Perusall Annotations

Use Perusall to annotate and discuss weekly anchor readings.

**What makes a substantive annotation?** Each annotation should include one or more of:

1. **Interpretation** of the annotated text
2. **Connections** between the text and your knowledge, class literature, or outside sources
3. **Questions** that push thinking forward ("I need to understand...")
4. **Theories** you're developing ("My theory is...")
5. **Experiences** from practice or perspectives based on your understanding

**Epistemic markers** (encouraged but not required):
- "I need to understand..."
- "My theory is..."
- "This connects to..."
- "This theory cannot explain..."

**Timing matters**: Begin annotations **no later than Wednesday** each week. Research shows "late arrivers" in online discussions receive less peer attention and miss learning opportunities.

### Wonderbits Contributions

Wonderbits is where ideas from Perusall annotations develop into deeper knowledge work.

**Forms of participation** (no minimum count—quality and engagement matter):
- Adding promising ideas from readings or class discussions
- Commenting on and building on peers' ideas
- Revising and improving earlier ideas
- Connecting ideas across weeks and topics
- Developing ideas toward your portfolio

**The flow**: Perusall (surface ideas through annotation) → Wonderbits (develop & connect ideas)

### Evaluation Criteria

| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Consistency** | Regular engagement across the semester |
| **Depth** | Substantive contributions that advance understanding |
| **Community Building** | Engaging with and building on peers' ideas |
| **Idea Development** | Evidence of thinking evolving over time |

---

## Facilitation (15%)

**Due**: Two selected weeks (sign up first day of class)

You will co-facilitate with a partner, taking on an expanded role as curators of promising ideas.

### Weekly Facilitator Tasks

| Task | When | Est. Time |
|------|------|-----------|
| Monitor Perusall, engage with peers | Mon–Wed | 30 min |
| Select 3–5 promising ideas → Wonderbits | Thu–Sat | 30 min |
| Write rise-above synthesis | Sat–Sun | 30 min |
| Lead opening discussion | In class | 20 min |

**Total**: ~2 hours per facilitation week

### Part 1: Curate Promising Ideas (Before Class)

During your assigned week:
- Monitor the class's annotations in Perusall
- Facilitate productive dialogues among peers
- By Saturday/Sunday: Import **3–5 promising ideas** from Perusall to Wonderbits
- Include brief rationale for each selection (1–2 sentences)

**What makes an idea "promising"?**
- Generates discussion or debate
- Connects to multiple perspectives or prior weeks
- Challenges or extends theory
- Has potential for further development

### Part 2: Rise-Above Synthesis (Before Class)

Write a short synthesis (200–300 words) that:
- Highlights emerging themes from the week's annotations
- Surfaces tensions or debates
- Identifies open questions worth pursuing
- Connects to prior weeks where relevant

### Part 3: Lead Class Discussion

With your co-facilitator:
- Share your rise-above synthesis at the start of class
- Guide the class through the promising ideas in Wonderbits
- Help students identify ideas they want to explore further
- Note emerging insights during class for potential addition to Wonderbits

**Submit your synthesis and presentation materials the morning of class.**

### Supports Provided

- Template for promising idea posts
- Rise-above synthesis prompts/scaffold
- Training during Week 1 class

## Idea Development Portfolio (40%)

**Due**: Final class (Week 15)
**Mid-Course Checkpoint**: Week 8

### Purpose

Curate a portfolio demonstrating your knowledge building journey, centered on **a problem you are eager to solve**.

### The Problem Focus

Each student identifies a problem or question that matters to them personally or professionally.

- **OK to be vague early**—the first weeks are for exploration and sharpening focus
- The problem becomes the through-line connecting all portfolio elements
- Could be: a design challenge, a practice puzzle, a research question, a professional problem

### Portfolio Arc

```
Early weeks:     Explore broadly → surface interests → identify problem direction
Mid-course:      Sharpen focus → develop relevant ideas → review pertinent literature
Late course:     Synthesize → connect to theory → articulate contribution
```

### Required Elements

All elements should connect to your problem focus:

#### 1. Developed Ideas (2–3 ideas)

Ideas you have taken ownership of and deepened over time.

- Can originate from your annotations, peers' ideas, or class discussions
- Each shows: initial idea → development → connections to theory
- Should be relevant to your problem focus

#### 2. Rise-Above Synthesis (1 synthesis)

Integrates multiple ideas and/or perspectives into higher-level understanding.

- Synthesizes across weeks/topics or diverse peer contributions
- Advances understanding of your problem or potential approaches
- Demonstrates ability to see patterns and connections

#### 3. Boundary Crossing Artifact (1 artifact)

Demonstrates learning across disciplines, perspectives, or contexts.

Options include:
- Applying your unique background/expertise to the problem
- Collaboration with peers from different backgrounds
- Connecting learning sciences theory to professional/practical context

#### 4. Literature Grounding (embedded throughout)

- Students naturally review relevant LS literature as they develop ideas
- This is woven into your developed ideas and synthesis—not a separate assignment
- Demonstrate engagement with course readings and beyond

#### 5. LS Topic Presentation (included in portfolio, 10% of portfolio grade)

Present your problem focus and relevant LS topic to the class.

- **When**: Sign up for a slot in Weeks 12–14
- **Format**: Short presentation with slides
- **Content**: The problem you're addressing, relevant LS theories/frameworks, your emerging thinking
- Receive peer feedback to strengthen final portfolio

### Optional Additions

- Application design or prototype
- Data analysis using LS framework
- Peer idea improvement (documented contribution to another's idea)
- External connection (current events, other courses, research)

### Using Wonderbits for Your Portfolio

Use the **Story feature** in Wonderbits to help develop your portfolio:
- Create stories at different time points to track your journey
- Curate and connect ideas that relate to your problem
- Build toward your final synthesis

### Mid-Course Checkpoint (Week 8)

Students share emerging portfolio work:
- Current problem focus (even if still evolving)
- Ideas you're developing
- Questions or challenges you're facing

**Purpose**: Peer feedback, surface issues early, create accountability

### Portfolio Rubric

| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Idea Improvement** | Evidence of deepening, refining, and advancing ideas over time |
| **Theoretical Grounding** | Connection to learning sciences theories and frameworks |
| **Synthesis & Rise-Above** | Ability to integrate diverse ideas into higher-level understanding |
| **Boundary Crossing** | Evidence of learning from/with diverse perspectives |
| **Problem Coherence** | Clear through-line connecting portfolio elements to your problem |

---

## Reflective Synthesis (15%)

**Due**: Final class (Week 15)

### Purpose

Reflect on your learning journey and contribution to the knowledge building community.

### Requirements

**Length**: 2–3 pages

**Address the following**:

1. **Evolution of understanding**: How has your understanding of learning sciences evolved through this course?

2. **Community contribution**: What ideas did you contribute to the community's knowledge? How did your ideas develop through interaction with peers?

3. **Learning from others**: What did you learn from peers that you couldn't have learned alone? Whose ideas influenced your thinking?

4. **Future application**: How might you apply knowledge building practices in your future work (research, teaching, design, policy, etc.)?

5. **Boundary crossing**: How did engaging with diverse perspectives (your own background and peers') shape your learning?

### Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Depth of reflection** | Moves beyond surface description to genuine insight |
| **Specific evidence** | References specific ideas, interactions, and artifacts |
| **Connection to KB principles** | Demonstrates understanding of collective knowledge advancement |
| **Forward thinking** | Articulates meaningful applications for future work |
