All readings are available on Perusall.

## How Readings Work

We use an **anchor + open library model**:

- **Anchor readings** (marked with ⚓): Everyone annotates these before class. They drive our shared discourse.
- **Section library**: All readings in the current section are open for exploration based on your problem focus.
- **Cumulative access**: Once a section is covered, those readings stay open.
