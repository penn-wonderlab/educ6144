## Course Description

This course surveys the theories, methods, and applications through which educational researchers understand learning and how to improve it. You will explore how the learning sciences field emerged, evolved, and continues to address current and future learning needs.

**This course is designed as a knowledge-building community.** Rather than simply learning *about* learning sciences concepts, we will practice *being* a community that takes collective cognitive responsibility for advancing ideas together. The diverse backgrounds you bring—spanning education, technology, design, policy, and beyond—are resources for boundary crossing and knowledge creation.

### Learning Goals

1. Investigate the roots of the learning sciences field and how it has evolved
2. Identify major theories and frameworks that fuel and support learning
3. Understand how learning processes interact with contextual and cultural variables
4. Develop skills in collaborating with a community to build new knowledge

### Course Structure

The course is organized into these sections:

- **Section 0: Agenda Setting and Culture Building** (Weeks 1–2) — Setting up our agenda and knowledge-building environment for the semester; define problems to be tackled
- **Section 1: Learning Processes** (Weeks 3–7) — Processes within individuals and groups that support learning
- **Section 2: Collaboration & Social Learning** (Weeks 8–11) — Frameworks defined by and promoted through collaboration
- **Section 3: Context & Culture** (Weeks 12–14) — How context and culture shape learning

## Learning Platforms

| Platform | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Canvas** | Course hub, grades, announcements |
| **Perusall** | Social annotation on readings |
| **Wonderbits** | Idea improvement, rise-above synthesis, portfolio |

**The flow**: Wonderbits (define and refine problems) → Perusall (surface ideas from readings) → Wonderbits (develop, connect, and synthesize ideas to tackle problems)

---

## Weekly Rhythm

Each week follows a pattern designed to support sustained knowledge building:

### Before Class (Asynchronous)
- **All students**: Annotate anchor readings in Perusall
- **Facilitators**: Curate promising ideas → Wonderbits; write rise-above synthesis

### During Class (Synchronous)
1. **Opening** (10 min): Facilitators share synthesis; class reviews promising ideas
2. **Discussion** (40 min): Instructor-led discussion weaving in promising ideas
3. **Design Mode** (30 min): Collaborative work on improving ideas and connecting to problems
4. **Closing** (10 min): Capture new promising ideas; preview connections

---

## Knowledge Building Contribution (30%)

Your ongoing participation in our knowledge building community through two platforms:

**Perusall**: Annotate anchor readings each week. Quality matters more than quantity. Effective annotations:
- Interpret and question the text
- Connect to other readings, your knowledge, or peers' ideas
- Surface tensions or puzzles worth exploring
- Connect to real problems the community aims to tackle

**Wonderbits**: Contribute to the community's knowledge base. This includes:
- Adding new ideas
- Building-on and improving existing ideas
- Revising and connecting ideas across weeks
- Building toward your portfolio

No minimum counts—engagement quality and consistency matter.

---

## Facilitation (15%)

You will facilitate or co-facilitate two weeks during the semester (one in each half). Facilitator responsibilities:

| Task | When | Time |
|------|------|------|
| Monitor Perusall, engage with peers | Mon–Thu | ~30 min |
| Select 3–5 promising ideas → Wonderbits | Fri–Sat | ~30 min |
| Write rise-above synthesis (200–300 words) | Fri–Sun | ~30 min |
| Lead opening discussion | In class | ~10 min |

Instructor will provide support and scaffolds along the way.

---

## Idea Development Portfolio (40%)

You will curate a portfolio demonstrating your knowledge building journey, centered on **a problem you are eager to solve**.

### The Problem Focus

Each student identifies a problem or question that matters to them. This could be:
- A design challenge in your professional context
- A practice puzzle you've encountered
- A research question you want to explore
- A professional problem you aim to address

**It's OK to be vague early.** The first weeks are for exploration. Your problem focus will sharpen over time and become the through-line connecting your portfolio work.

### Idea Development Arc

- Early weeks:     Explore broadly → surface interests → identify problem direction
- Mid-course:      Sharpen focus → develop relevant ideas → review pertinent literature
- Late course:     Synthesize → connect to theory → articulate contribution


### Required Elements

All connected to your problem focus:

1. **2–3 Developed Ideas** — Ideas you took ownership of and deepened
   - Show the arc: initial idea → development → connections to theory
   - Can originate from your annotations, peer ideas, or class discussions

2. **1 Rise-Above Synthesis** — Integrates multiple ideas/perspectives
   - Synthesizes across weeks or diverse peer contributions
   - Advances understanding of your problem or potential approaches

3. **1 Boundary Crossing Artifact** — Learning across disciplines/perspectives
   - Applies your unique background to the problem, OR
   - Documents collaboration with peers from different backgrounds, OR
   - Connects LS theory to your professional/practical context

4. **Literature Grounding** — Embedded throughout (not a separate assignment)
   - As you develop ideas, you naturally review relevant LS literature
   - This replaces the traditional "topic review" paper

### Problem Presentation (part of portfolio)

Each student will present on their core problem and how learning sciences ideas inform it. It is focused on examining what the problem is really about, based on literature analysis of the problem. Sign up for a slot in Weeks 9-12. Brief presentation with slides, followed by peer discussion.

### Optional Additions

- Application design or prototype
- Data analysis using an LS framework
- External connection (current events, other courses, ongoing research)

### Portfolio Development

Use the **Story** feature in Wonderbits to develop your portfolio. You can create multiple stories at different points in the semester to track your evolving thinking.

### Mid-Course Checkpoint (Week 8)

Share your emerging portfolio work for peer feedback on:
- Problem focus clarity
- Idea development progress
- Connections you're making

### Portfolio Rubric

| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Idea Improvement** | Evidence of deepening, refining, and advancing ideas over time |
| **Theoretical Grounding** | Connection to learning sciences theories and frameworks |
| **Synthesis & Rise-Above** | Ability to integrate diverse ideas into higher-level understanding |
| **Boundary Crossing** | Evidence of learning from/with diverse perspectives |
| **Reflection & Metacognition** | Awareness of own learning and contribution to community |

---

## Reflective Synthesis (15%)

A final 2–3 page reflection addressing:
- How has your understanding of learning sciences evolved?
- What ideas did you contribute to the community's knowledge?
- What did you learn from peers that you couldn't have learned alone?
- How might you apply knowledge building practices in your future work?

Due: Week 15

## Reading Structure

We use an **anchor + open library model** to balance shared discussion with problem-driven exploration.

### Three Layers

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Anchor Readings** (1–2 per week) | Everyone annotates; drives class discussion |
| **Section Library** | All readings in current section open for exploration |
| **Extended Resources** | Problem-specific sources you find and add to Wonderbits |

### How It Works

- Each week has 1–2 **anchor readings** that everyone annotates in Perusall
- All readings within the current section are available for optional exploration
- By end of course, all readings are accessible for your portfolio work

This allows you to follow your problem across weekly boundaries while maintaining shared reference points for collective discourse.

---

## Pre-Course: Learner Identity Profile

Before the first class, complete your profile in Wonderbits:
- Your background (academic, professional, personal)
- Your passions and aspirations
- What you hope to learn from peers
- What others might learn from you

In Week 1, we'll explore the directory and connect with peers across boundaries.

---

## Key Expectations

- **Attendance**: Attend every class. Arrive on time. First class attendance is mandatory. Contact instructor *before* class if you must miss.
- **Preparation**: Complete anchor reading annotations before class.
- **Engagement**: Participate actively in building our collective knowledge—in class and online.
- **Late Work**: Extensions must be negotiated in advance.
